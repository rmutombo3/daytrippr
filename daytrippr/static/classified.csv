He comes from a high-powered showbiz family, which includes brothers Alec, Daniel and wait a minute this is Stephen<br> Baldwin’s bio- oops. My bad. Stephen LYNCH is a songwriter, comedian and Tony award-nominated actor. His songs are known for their haunting melodies, complex and Lord-pleasing chord structures and insightful lyrics, often exploring the universal themes of heartbreak, family strife, and forgetting one’s safeword during a particularly brutal S&M session.<p>Lynch has released four studio albums, four live albums and two concert specials, including Live at the El Rey in 2004 and his latest, Hello, Kalamazoo! in 2016. His most recent recording, the double live/studio album My Old Heart was released in summer of 2019 and reached the #1 spot on Billboard’s Comedy charts. He also was a contestant on 2013’s All-Star Celebrity Apprentice dammit that’s Baldwin again- sorry. As the result of the duality of his act, Lynch often plays venues more often suited to music than comedy, eventually graduating from the bars and VFW halls of the early days to locations such as Town Hall, Shepherd’s Bush Empire and the esteemed Carnegie Hall. He gained great national exposure with his Comedy Central Presents special in 2000, one of the highest rated in the network’s history. He has made appearances on Comedy Central’s Premium Blend, The World Comedy Tour and The World Stands Up and has performed at the prestigious Just for Laughs Comedy Festival in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He starred in his second Comedy Central Presents in 2008.<p>In April 2006, Lynch starred as Robbie Hart in the Broadway musical The Wedding Singer, which ran on Broadway from April 27, 2006 through December 31, 2006 at the Al Hirschfeld Theatre. This musical production was based on the 1998 New Line Cinema film The Wedding Singer starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. The musical, Lynch’s Broadway debut, co-starred Tony winner Laura Benanti in the role of Julia Sullivan, played by Barrymore in the film. The April 2006 opening followed a successful preview run in Seattle at The 5th Avenue Theatre which ran from January 31 through February 19. His performance has earned him nominations for Tony, Drama League and Drama Desk awards.<p>Lynch performed on his first European tours in 2008, headlining concerts in England, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, Finland, Ireland, Scotland and Germany. All but two of the seventeen shows sold out, despite never playing a majority of the markets. Lynch attributes this success to YouTube.<p>His newfound European popularity resulted in appearances at six festivals in August and September 2008. He played in the UK at the Reading and Leeds Festivals, headlining the Alternative stage at each site. He also appeared at the Lowlands Festival in the Netherlands on August 17, Edinburgh Edge Festival (during Fringe) on August 24, The Pimm’s Summerfest in Holland Park, London on August 28, and Bulmer’s Comedy Festival in Dublin at the Olympia Theater on September 1 and 2. He returned to Europe in Fall, 2009 and toured the UK in March 2010, headlining London’s Brixton Academy on March 5, 2010. Lynch’s second studio album, 3 Balloons, was released on March 10, 2009.<p>Lion, Lynch’s first double live/studio recording was released in November, 2012. He toured the world behind that album with his band, consisting of Rod Cone, Charlie King and singer/songwriter Courtney Jaye. They would hone the act that would eventually make up 2016’s Hello, Kalamazoo! special.<p>In 2017 Lynch did a tour of the United States to test out the material that would end up on My Old Heart. In 2018 he recorded the album and embarked on two European tours. He is currently writing and recording his next album. He does not know Stephen Baldwin.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p>",,32, 58, 'Abundant sunshine.

Do you want to increase the scale of your work, but feel intimidated by large pieces of clay? The truth is, you don’t have to be a big, strong person to make big, strong pots! Join Anja and Gabriel as they demystify the techniques used to produce large scale pottery. Demos will include throwing wide diameter bowls, section building skyscraper pots, centering 50-100 lbs. of clay, and creative ways to make voluminous storage jars. These techniques are simple, fun, and easy to learn. You’ll be amazed at the pieces you create! The class will include plenty of studio and one-on-one time with the instructors.

About The Art Exhibit for Nov 06-30th


NWG New Window Gallery presents: Theresa Mcgrath



Pottery And Jewelry Artist!


Artist Statement:

New Window Gallery of Valdese NC is looking forwards to displaying art created by Theresa Mcgrath Nov 06-30th !


&quot;I make whimsical, sometimes functional pottery, and jewelry&quot;.


Theresa Mcgrath grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area, and graduated from San Francisco State University with a BA in theatre arts, emphasizing design. She later moved to Watauga County in 2009, after retiring from the San Francisco Department of Public Works, where she was a general foreman. &quot;I came to the mountains, drawn by a lifelong interest in Appalachian music, folklore, and traditional crafts&quot;. She also loves gardening and growing her own food. She began taking classes in jewelry making and pottery at the Western Watauga Community Center and at ASU. &quot;I love to use vintage materials and found objects in my jewelry&quot;. All of her work is influenced by her love of nature, folklore and folk art. Theresa currently works for local Potter Cindy Pacileo, and is a member of the Western Watauga Jewelry Guild and Potter&#39;s of the Blue Ridge. Her work can be found at the Blue Ridge Artisan Gallery in Wilkesboro; The Arts Depot in Abingdon VA. and the Florence Thomas Art School in West Jefferson.
Theresa learned of New Window Gallery/Play It Again Records providing window space for artists from the Caldwell Arts Council.



New Window Gallery is located at 150 W Main St. Valdese NC.

It is part of the Play It Again Records Building.

The two large gallery windows are lit 24 hrs. a day and can be seen from the curb!

The gallery is looking for more interesting artists to participate in future events!

A HISTORY OF STAND UP COMEDY

Presented by Marquee Comedy as a limited residency at The Magnetic Theatre

It’s a funny and insightful multi-media presentation about the history of an original American art form, stand-up comedy, and what all the jokes and laughter say about America. The stories of forgotten trailblazers, martyred iconoclasts and familiar stars show how the simple act of one joker taking on a crowd became one of our most popular entertainments, and a cultural weathervane.

Ritch Shydner&#39;s Bio

In the 1980’s, Ritch Shydner made numerous appearances on TV, including Late Night with David Letterman and The Tonight Show with both Johnny Carson and Jay Leno. He also did an HBO half-hour special, One Night Stand. He played Al Bundy’s co-worker on Married with Children, and made guest appearances on many other TV shows, such as Designing Women and Roseanne. Ritch was able to translate his modest success on TV into an obscure film career, appearing in Steve Martin’s Roxanne and Eddie Murphy&#39;s Beverly Hills Cop II before moving on to minor roles on smaller pictures. He wrote for sitcoms such as Roseanne, The Jeff Foxworthy Show, and HBO’s The Mind of the Married Man. Ritch wrote material for Jeff Foxworthy, Ron White, and Jay Leno.

This public presentation is a rebroadcast of a private live interactive question-and-answer session with Dr. Goodall and Appalachian State University students that will occur on Wednesday, November 18th. 

Jane Goodall was born on April 3, 1934, in London, England. From earliest childhood, she was fascinated by animals and the Africa she discovered in the storybooks of Tarzan and Dr. Doolittle.  In 1957, she traveled to the Kenyan farm of a friend&#39;s parents and met the famed anthropologist and paleontologist Dr. Louis Leakey. In 1960, at his invitation, she began her landmark study of chimpanzee behavior in what is now Tanzania. Her field research at what was then called Gombe Stream Chimpanzee Reserve — most notably, her discovery that chimpanzees make and use tools — revolutionized the world of primatology and redefined the relationship between humans and animals.

And what does it mean when we refer to “other”? Buddha’s teachings on exchanging self with others allow us to use profound wisdom to open our hearts and truly empathize with others. The more we learn to see the world from others’ point of view, the more our empathy will grow. This will not only help us in all of our relationships, it will naturally inspire great meaning within our life, and enable us to develop universal compassion, the springboard from which enlightenment will arise.
This free public talk is open to everyone as well as acts as an introduction to our special “Illuminating Wisdom” - Wisdom Buddha Manjushri Empowerment and Commentary Day https://meditationingeorgia.org/empowerment/
